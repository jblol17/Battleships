This project was assigned to my Python class, where the objective was to make a game where you assembled
your ships with the limited resources you had and then fought against the computer. This involved that we
make lists of ships and a dictionary with ship attributes, as well as making the general logic of the game. 
The attack pattern was based on randomly generating numbers to see which/how many ships in your fleet could 
attack per round.
